# Easter-Calculator-website
This project was created as a coursework undertaking during the first year of study at Cardiff University. It involved the development of a website that employs the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) to interact with a Python program and provide users with information pertaining to the day and month on which Easter falls in a given year. The website features a user-friendly form where users can input the year and radio buttons to select their desired output format, including numerical, verbose, or both. The Python program utilizes the Gauss algorithm to calculate the date of Easter based on the user's input year and formatting options. The website's design is aesthetically pleasing and intuitive, utilizing an external Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) stylesheet to format both the form and output. An additional feature was implemented to add a superscript to the day of the month in verbose format, garnering an additional credit mark. Overall, this project successfully produced a website that effectively interacts with a Python program via CGI to provide users with the desired information regarding the date of Easter in various formats.
